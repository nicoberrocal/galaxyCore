## üéØ Quick Start

### 1. Create Player Tree State

```go
import "time"

playerID := "player_123"
now := time.Now()
treeState := NewFormationTreeState(playerID, now)
```

### 2. Award Experience from Battle

```go
result := BattleResult{
    Victory:             true,
    FlawlessVictory:     false,
    OutnumberedWin:      false,
    EnemyShipsDestroyed: 12,
    DamageDone:          4500,
    DamageTaken:         1200,
    FormationUsed:       FormationLine,
    BattleDuration:      5 * time.Minute,
    EnemyFormation:      FormationVanguard,
    CounterAdvantage:    true, // Line counters Vanguard
}

gain := CalculateExperienceGain(result, now)
treeState.AwardExperience(gain)
// Player now has XP to spend
```

### 3. Unlock Nodes

```go
// Get a tree
lineTree := FormationTreeCatalog[FormationLine]

// Get first node
node := &lineTree.Nodes[0] // "Defensive Stance"

// Check if can unlock
canUnlock, msg := treeState.CanUnlockNode(node)
if !canUnlock {
    fmt.Println("Cannot unlock:", msg)
}

// Unlock it
result := treeState.UnlockNode(node, now)
if result.Success {
    fmt.Println("Unlocked:", node.Name)
    fmt.Println("XP remaining:", result.XPRemaining)
}
```

### 4. Compute Stats with Tree Bonuses

```go
// Old way (deprecated)
mods, _, _ := ComputeLoadout(ship, role, loadout)

// New way with tree bonuses
stack, finalMods, abilities := ComputeLoadoutV2WithTree(
    ship,
    role,
    loadout,
    formation,
    position,
    ships,
    treeState, // ‚Üê Applies all unlocked node bonuses
    now,
    inCombat,
)

// finalMods now includes tree bonuses!
```

### 5. Check Custom Effects

```go
// Some nodes have special mechanics
effects := GetTreeCustomEffects(treeState, FormationSkirmish)

if effects["hit_and_run"] != nil {
    params := effects["hit_and_run"]
    chance := params["chance"].(float64)
    // 25% chance to disengage without counterattack
}

if HasTreeCustomEffect(treeState, FormationSwarm, "locust_cloud") {
    // Swarm is untargetable by single-target abilities
}
```

### 6. Calculate Effective Counters

```go
// Base counter
baseCounter := GetFormationCounterMultiplier(FormationLine, FormationVanguard)
// = 1.3 (30% bonus)

// With tree bonuses
effectiveCounter := CalculateEffectiveCounterMultiplier(
    FormationLine,
    FormationVanguard,
    attackerTreeState,
)
// Could be 1.5 if player unlocked "Enfilade Fire" node
```

### 7. Reset Tree

```go
// Check reset cost
cost := treeState.GetResetCost(now)
if cost.IsFree {
    fmt.Println("Free reset available!")
} else {
    fmt.Printf("Reset costs %d credits\\n", cost.Credits)
}

// Reset
treeState.ResetTree(now, true) // Use free reset
// All XP refunded, nodes cleared
```

## üìä Example Tree Progression

```
Player starts:
- 0 XP
- 0 nodes unlocked
- Rank: Ensign

After 5 victories:
- 350 XP
- Rank: Lieutenant
- Unlocked: Tactical Awareness (global), Defensive Stance (Line)

After 20 victories:
- 1,800 XP  
- Rank: Commodore
- Unlocked 8 nodes in Line tree
- Unlocked 3 nodes in global tree
- Can unlock Tier 3 nodes

After 50 victories:
- 5,000 XP
- Rank: Rear Admiral  
- Specialized in Line Formation
- Unlocked ultimate: "Supreme Overlord of the Line"
- Line formation cannot be countered
- All Line bonuses +25%
- Has "Perfect Line" ability (freeze enemy formation)
```

## üéÆ Game Design Notes

### Strategic Depth
- Players choose 2-3 formations to specialize in
- Global tree provides baseline improvements
- Mutually exclusive nodes create meaningful choices
- Reset mechanics allow experimentation with cost

### Progression Curve
- Early game: Unlock Tier 1 nodes (cheap, broad bonuses)
- Mid game: Specialize in 1-2 formations (Tier 2-3)
- Late game: Unlock ultimate nodes (Tier 4, game-changing)

### Build Diversity
Examples of valid builds:
1. **Generalist** - Unlock all Tier 1 nodes across all formations
2. **Line Specialist** - Deep investment in Line tree
3. **Hybrid** - Line + Skirmish for versatility
4. **Support Master** - Focus on global tree for fleet-wide bonuses

### Balance Levers
- XP gain rates (battles, quests, daily)
- Node costs
- Effect magnitudes
- Reset costs
- Free reset frequency

## üéØ Key Achievements

‚úÖ **Problem Solved**: Replaced 1000+ lines of hardcoded synergies with player-driven progression  
‚úÖ **Complexity Reduced**: Moved from combinatorial explosion to curated tree nodes  
‚úÖ **Engagement Added**: Long-term progression goals  
‚úÖ **Balance Improved**: Bounded power scaling  
‚úÖ **Integration Complete**: Works with V2 compute system  

## üöÄ You're Ready!

The Formation Mastery Tree system is fully implemented and integrated with your V2 compute architecture. Players can now earn XP, unlock nodes, specialize their formations, and see real stat bonuses applied through the modifier stack system.

Time to build the UI and start balancing! üéÆ
