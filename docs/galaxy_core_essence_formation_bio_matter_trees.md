**Meet the echelons, beings so ancient their evolution line was kept intact even through the birth and extinction of several universes, and their body even merged with reality giving them a spectral appearance. The cosmos has no more secrets to offer them, so they guard the health of the multiverse from becoming lifeless and stale. When a galaxy loses diversity they, through a process of mergers, they reshape reality with evolution and competition again and again. Forever. The multiverses have 4 different cosmic essences that define universe parametrization and distinct physics, in which life must adapt. The merger process joins different realities together into a plane, the galaxy, and each cosmic essence fights to survive, with tactical, biological and matter masteries. The player can choose a cosmic essence, and can choose between 4 biology and matter trees. The biology tree defines aspects of the behavior and bonuses for the ships. The matter tree defines the abilities and auras for the ships. The tree must have mutually exclusive paths.
The actual storyline is TBD.


Cosmic Essences**
---


**1. Vital Continuum (Overflowing Life)**
---



* **Universe property: Energy abundance, slow entropy. Life grows unstoppably.**



* **Civ adaptation: Everything tends toward resilience/regeneration.**



* **Unique feature: Passive hull regen (like Protoss shield, but organic).**



* **Gameplay: Hard to wipe out, grows back if not finished.**



* **Scouting impact: Scouts reveal “growth points” — places where regen is strongest (nebulae, suns).**
  

##### **2. Entropic Verge (Decay-Timeline)**



* **Universe property: Accelerated entropy. Matter and energy collapse fast.**



* **Civ adaptation: Life learns to burn hot and recycle wreckage.**



* **Unique feature: All ships deal bonus damage at low HP, and fleets harvest wrecks for resources.**



* **Gameplay: They snowball from destruction — let them kill anything and they profit.**



* **Scouting impact: Scouts can tag wreckage, denying harvest (high-level counterplay).**





##### **3. Causality Web (Broken Time)**



* **Universe property: Past and future bleed into the present. Cause ≠ effect.**



* **Civ adaptation: Cultures use probability tricks, recursive actions, predictive warfare.**



* **Unique feature: Fleets get “echo effects” — first action repeats in weaker form (attacks, movements, abilities).**



* **Gameplay: Trickster play — even predictable units can pull unexpected doubles.**



* **Scouting impact: Good scouts reveal “probability weights” (predict what echo is most likely to happen).**





##### **4. Null Horizon (Matterless Realm)**



* **Universe property: Matter flickers, only energy fields persist stably.**



* **Civ adaptation: Ships rely on phasing, intangibility, echo-shadows.**



* **Unique feature: 15–20% innate chance to ignore damage completely (phasing).**



* **Gameplay: Infuriating to pin down — they melt if caught, but many hits just… miss.**



* **Scouting impact: Scouts reveal “phase rhythm” — the flicker pattern timing.**
