# Ability Combo System

This document describes ability synergies and combo mechanics across the ship roster.

## Combo Categories

### 7. **Formation-Enhanced Combos**

#### Ramming Speed → Vanguard Formation
- **Ships**: Cruiser in Vanguard formation
- **Effect**: Charge damage + Vanguard's +25% attack damage = devastating rush
- **Best Use**: Aggressive opening against defensive formations

#### Standoff Pattern → Back Position

- **Effect**: +range from ability + Back position's +20% attack range = extreme range
- **Best Use**: Siege warfare or kiting melee-heavy fleets

#### Alpha Strike → Front Position
- **Ships**: Destroyer in Front formation position
- **Effect**: First-volley bonus + Front position's +30% damage multiplier = massive opener
- **Best Use**: Vanguard formation alpha strikes

### 8. **Cross-Ship Synergy Combos**

#### Decoy Beacon → Active Camo → Backstab
- **Ships**: Scout (Decoy) + Stealth Frigate (Camo + Backstab)
- **Effect**: Enemy focuses on decoy while cloaked assassin strikes backline
- **Best Use**: Misdirection tactics in large engagements

## Tips for Combo Execution

1. **Timing**: Coordinate ability activations (Alpha Strike before Antimatter Burst)
2. **Positioning**: Place ships in optimal formation positions for bonuses
3. **Target Priority**: Focus combos on high-value targets (Carriers, Artillery)
4. **Redundancy**: Have backup ships for critical combos (2 Corvettes for scout hunting)
5. **Counter-Play**: Scout enemy formations and adapt combos accordingly
6. **Resource Management**: Don't waste all cooldowns at once, stagger for sustained pressure

## Combo Notation

Format: `[Ship1: Ability] → [Ship2: Ability] = [Effect]`

Example: `[Scout: Ping] → [Corvette: Antimatter Burst] = One-shot medium ships`
