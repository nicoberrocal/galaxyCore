## System Integration

### 1. Formation Types & Properties

Seven distinct formation types, each with unique characteristics:

| Formation | Speed Mult | Reconfig Time | Special Properties |
|-----------|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Line | 1.0x | 120s | Balanced, frontal strength |
| Box | 0.75x | 150s | Defensive, all-around protection |
| Vanguard | 1.1x | 60s | Aggressive, fast reconfig |
| Skirmish | 1.2x | 90s | Mobile, hit-and-run |
| Echelon | 0.95x | 120s | Asymmetric, staggered |
| Phalanx | 0.8x | 180s | Frontal fortress |
| Swarm | 1.05x | 100s | Dispersed, anti-AoE |

### 2. Formation Counter System

Rock-paper-scissors mechanics between formations:

**Key Counters:**
- Vanguard beats Box (1.3x), loses to Line (0.7x)
- Skirmish beats Phalanx (1.3x), loses to Vanguard (0.6x)
- Box beats Line (1.2x), loses to Vanguard (0.7x)
- Line beats Vanguard (1.3x), loses to Box (0.8x)

### 3. Position-Based Damage Distribution

Damage is distributed based on attack direction:

| Direction | Front | Flank | Back | Support |
|-----------|-------|-------|------|---------|
| Frontal | 60% | 20% | 10% | 10% |
| Flanking | 30% | 40% | 20% | 10% |
| Rear | 10% | 30% | 50% | 10% |
| Envelopment | 25% | 25% | 25% | 25% |

### 4. Integration with Role Modes

**Tactical Mode:**
- -30% formation reconfiguration time
- +10% effectiveness to position bonuses
- Enhanced counter multipliers (+0.1x)

**Economic Mode:**

**Economic Convoy** (3 Drones, 1 Carrier):
- +30% Transport Capacity, -10% Upkeep, -5% Construction Cost

**Rapid Response** (1 Bomber, 1 Carrier, 1 Destroyer):
- -20% Warp Charge, -25% Warp Scatter, +15% Interdiction Resist

### 8. Auto-Assignment Logic

Ships are automatically assigned to optimal positions based on their characteristics:

- **Drones** → Support (economic/utility)
- **Scouts** → Flank (fast, mobile)
- **Fighters** → Front (versatile combatants)
- **Bombers** → Back (long-range siege)
- **Carriers** → Support/Front (tanky support, defensive formations)
- **Destroyers** → Front/Flank (heavy hitters, mobile)

### 9. Formation Templates

Pre-configured formation setups with conditional requirements:

1. **Standard Battle Line** - Fighters front, balanced approach
2. **Defensive Box** - All-around defense for sieges
3. **Blitz Vanguard** - Aggressive alpha strike
4. **Hit and Run Skirmish** - Mobile strike force
5. **Mining Operation** - Economic resource gathering (Economic mode)
6. **Recon Sweep** - Scouting formation (Recon mode)

Templates can be auto-selected based on:
- Available ship types and counts
- Current role mode
- Enemy formation (counter-picking)
- Formation counter advantages

## Tactical Depth

### Layers of Strategy

   - Choose based on enemy formation (counter-picking)
   - Match to role mode (Tactical/Economic/Recon/Scientific)
   - Consider fleet composition
   - Balance speed vs defense

2. **Position Assignment**
   - Place tanky ships at Front
   - Put fast ships at Flank
   - Long-range ships at Back
   - Support/utility at Support
   - Consider gem-position synergies

3. **Gem Socketing**
   - Socket gems matching ship position
   - Laser/Nuclear gems for Front line
   - Sensor gems for Back line
   - Warp/Engineering for Support
   - Maximize position synergy bonuses

4. **Ability Usage**
   - Use abilities from optimal positions
   - Focus Fire from Front
   - Evasive Maneuvers from Flank
   - Standoff Pattern from Back
   - Point Defense from Support

5. **Composition Building**
   - Build fleets to unlock composition bonuses
   - Mix ship types for versatility
   - Specialize for specific strategies
   - Balance between synergy and flexibility

### Counter-Play Examples

**Scenario 1: Enemy using Box Formation**
- Response: Use Vanguard (1.3x advantage)
- Position destroyers at Front for aggressive push
- Use Alpha Strike from Front position
- Fast reconfiguration (60s) allows adaptation

**Scenario 2: Enemy using Vanguard**
- Response: Use Line (1.3x advantage) or Box (1.3x)
- Front-heavy defensive positioning
- Use defensive abilities and shield gems
- Absorb initial assault and counter

**Scenario 3: Enemy using Phalanx**
- Response: Use Skirmish (1.3x advantage)
- Flank-heavy positioning with scouts and fighters
- Use hit-and-run tactics
- Attack from flanking direction to exploit weakness

**Scenario 4: Mining Operation**
- Formation: Box for all-around defense
- Position: Drones in Support, Fighters in Front
- Mode: Economic for gathering bonuses
- Gems: Engineering gems in Support for efficiency

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Setting a Formation

```go
// Create a new stack
stack := &ShipStack{
    Ships: map[ShipType][]HPBucket{
        Fighter: {{HP: 200, Count: 10}},
        Bomber: {{HP: 500, Count: 5}},
        Scout: {{HP: 100, Count: 8}},
    },
    Role: RoleTactical,
}

// Set formation
now := time.Now()
eta := stack.SetFormation(FormationVanguard, now)
// Formation will be active after reconfiguration time
```

### Example 2: Getting Effective Ship Stats in Formation

```go
// Get effective stats for a fighter in front position
effectiveShip, abilities := stack.EffectiveShipInFormation(Fighter, 0)

// effectiveShip now includes:
// - Base blueprint stats
// - Role mode bonuses (Tactical)
// - Gem bonuses from loadout
// - Formation position bonuses (Front)
// - Role-formation synergy bonuses
// - Gem-position synergy bonuses
// - Composition bonuses
```

### Example 3: Combat with Formations

```go
// Execute a battle round
result := ExecuteFormationBattleRound(attackerStack, defenderStack)

fmt.Printf("Formation Advantage: %.2fx\n", result.FormationAdvantage)
fmt.Printf("Attacker dealt %d damage\n", result.AttackerDamageDealt)
fmt.Printf("Defender dealt %d damage\n", result.DefenderDamageDealt)
fmt.Printf("Attacker lost: %v\n", result.AttackerShipsLost)
fmt.Printf("Defender lost: %v\n", result.DefenderShipsLost)
```

### Example 4: Auto-Selecting Best Formation

```go
// Find best formation against enemy
template := FindBestTemplate(
    stack.Ships,
    stack.Role,
    enemyStack.Formation.Type,
)

if template != nil {
    stack.SetFormation(template.Formation, time.Now())
}
```

### Example 5: Checking Composition Bonuses

```go
// Evaluate active composition bonuses
bonusMods, activeBonuses := EvaluateCompositionBonuses(stack.Ships)

for _, bonus := range activeBonuses {
    fmt.Printf("Active: %s - %s\n", bonus.Type, bonus.Description)
}
```

## Balance Considerations

### Risk vs Reward
- **Specialized formations:** High bonuses but predictable and counter-able
- **Balanced formations:** Adaptive but lower peak performance
- **Counter-picking:** Requires scouting, rewards intelligence gathering

### Economic Considerations
- Formation changes cost time (60-180 seconds)
- Reconfiguration time affected by role mode
- Tactical mode reduces time by 30%
- Economic mode increases time by 50%

### Micro-Management vs Automation
- Auto-assignment provides good default positioning
- Manual assignment allows optimization
- Templates provide pre-configured strategies
- Auto-selection can counter enemy formations

### Scalability
- Formation system works with HP bucket system
- Supports mixed ship type stacks
- Bucket-level granularity enables precise tactics
- Performance maintained through efficient distribution algorithms
