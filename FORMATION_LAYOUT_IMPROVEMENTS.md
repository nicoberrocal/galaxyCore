# Formation Layout System - Improvements Summary

## What Was Improved

The formation layout system in `ships/formation_layouts.go` has been completely redesigned to better support your browser-based MMORTS with the following goals:

1. **Visual representation** of stacked ships showing one ship per formation position
2. **Dynamic expansion** as ships are added to formation positions
3. **Tactical accuracy** reflecting formation counter matrix and damage distribution
4. **Frontend-ready** with helper functions and JSON serialization

---

## Key Changes

### 1. Redesigned Initial Layouts
**All 7 formation types** now have improved initial coordinates that reflect their tactical characteristics:

- **LINE**: Balanced front-back with exposed flanks
- **BOX**: Defensive perimeter with even distribution
- **VANGUARD**: Sharp spearhead for aggressive deployment
- **SKIRMISH**: Very wide flanks for hit-and-run
- **ECHELON**: Diagonal staggered arrangement
- **PHALANX**: Massively wide front line
- **SWARM**: Hexagonal dispersion for anti-AoE

### 2. Complete Expansion Rules
**Every position in every formation** now has expansion logic:

| Formation | Front | Flank | Back | Support |
|-----------|-------|-------|------|---------|
| Line | ✅ Column | ✅ Alternating | ✅ Column | ✅ Behind front |
| Box | ✅ Fill center | ✅ Outward | ✅ Mirror front | ✅ Circular |
| Vanguard | ✅ Reinforce tip | ✅ Widen V | ✅ Alternating | ✅ Stack back |
| Skirmish | ✅ Fill gap | ✅ Very wide | ✅ Backward | ✅ Center cluster |
| Echelon | ✅ Diagonal | ✅ Diagonal alt | ✅ Diagonal | ✅ Back-left |
| Phalanx | ✅ Wider line | ✅ Far out | ✅ Tight column | ✅ Behind front |
| Swarm | ✅ Hex rings | ✅ Hex offset | ✅ Hex offset | ✅ Hex gaps |

### 3. New Helper Functions

#### `GetInitialSlots(formationType, position)`
Returns the base coordinates for a position.

#### `GetNextSlotCoordinate(formationType, position, existingCount)`
Gets the next slot coordinate when expanding (handles initial + expansion seamlessly).

#### `GetAllSlotsForPosition(formationType, position, totalCount)`
Returns all coordinates up to a specified count.

#### `GenerateFormationLayoutSnapshot(formationType, slotCounts)`
**⭐ Recommended for frontend** - Generates complete layout with metadata and bounds.

#### `CalculateFormationBounds(formationType, slotCounts)`
Returns bounding box for centering/scaling.

### 4. New Data Types

```go
type FormationLayoutSnapshot struct {
    FormationType FormationType
    Positions     map[FormationPosition][]SlotPosition
    Bounds        LayoutBounds
}

type SlotPosition struct {
    Coordinate SlotCoordinate
    SlotIndex  int
    IsInitial  bool  // Distinguishes initial vs expanded slots
}

type LayoutBounds struct {
    MinX, MaxX, MinY, MaxY float64
}
```

## Design Principles

### ✅ Tactical Accuracy
Visual layouts match formation characteristics from `FormationCatalog`:
- Phalanx's wide front reflects "frontal_fortress" and "extreme_flank_weakness"
- Skirmish's wide flanks reflect "mobile" and "hit_and_run"
- Swarm's dispersion reflects "anti_aoe" and "splash_resistant"

### ✅ Damage Distribution Alignment
Position density correlates with `DirectionalDamageWeights`:
- Frontal attacks: 60% front, 20% flank, 10% back, 10% support
- Formations emphasize positions that receive more damage

### ✅ Counter Matrix Support
Visual arrangements reflect `FormationCounterMatrix` relationships:
- Phalanx (wide) vs Vanguard (concentrated) = 1.25x
- Skirmish (flanks) vs Phalanx (exposed flanks) = 1.3x
- Box (perimeter) vs Vanguard (single point) = 1.3x

### ✅ Expansion Maintains Character
Each formation grows in a way that preserves its tactical identity:
- Phalanx front gets progressively wider
- Vanguard reinforces the spearhead
- Swarm adds hexagonal rings

## Usage Examples

### Backend: Generate Layout for API Response

```go
// Count ships in each position from Formation.Assignments
slotCounts := map[FormationPosition]int{
    PositionFront:   5,
    PositionFlank:   4,
    PositionBack:    2,
    PositionSupport: 3,
}

// Generate snapshot
snapshot := GenerateFormationLayoutSnapshot(FormationVanguard, slotCounts)

// Send to frontend as JSON
jsonData, _ := json.Marshal(snapshot)
```

### Frontend: Render Formation

```javascript
// Receive snapshot from API
const snapshot = await fetchFormationLayout(fleetId);

// Scale and center
const scale = 40; // pixels per unit
const centerX = canvas.width / 2;
const centerY = canvas.height / 2;

// Render each position
for (const [position, slots] of Object.entries(snapshot.positions)) {
  for (const slot of slots) {
    const x = centerX + (slot.coordinate.x * scale);
    const y = centerY - (slot.coordinate.y * scale); // Flip Y
    
    drawShip(position, x, y, slot.isInitial);
  }
}
```

  - `ExampleFormationComparison()` - Compare all formations
  - `ExampleFormationGrowth()` - Watch formation expand
  - `ExampleSwarmHexPattern()` - Hexagonal pattern demo

- ✅ `docs/FORMATION_LAYOUTS.md` - Comprehensive documentation
  - System overview and concepts
  - All 7 formation types with visual diagrams
  - Complete API reference
  - Frontend integration guide
  - Design principles
  - Performance considerations

---

## Integration Points

### ✅ Works With Existing Systems
- **Formation.Assignments**: Count ships per position to get slot counts
- **FormationCatalog**: Visual layouts reflect formation specs
- **FormationCounterMatrix**: Arrangements support counter relationships
- **DirectionalDamageWeights**: Density matches damage distribution
- **Combat System**: Purely visual, no impact on combat calculations

### ✅ Performance
- Ships remain **stacked** in HP buckets (no performance impact)
- Layout system is **cosmetic only**
- Frontend displays **one sprite per slot**
- Ships move as a **unit** (same velocity)

---

## Testing

```bash
# Build verification
go build ./ships

# Run examples (if you create test functions)
go run ships/formation_layouts_example.go
```

---

## Next Steps

### Recommended
1. **Create API endpoint** that calls `GenerateFormationLayoutSnapshot()`
2. **Implement frontend renderer** using the snapshot JSON
3. **Add formation rotation** (mirror echelon, rotate based on facing)
4. **Add smooth transitions** when reconfiguring formations

### Optional Enhancements
- **Ship type differentiation**: Different sprites per ship type in position
- **Formation density adjustment**: Scale spacing based on ship size
- **Collision detection**: Prevent formation overlap
- **Animation**: Smooth reconfiguration transitions
- **LOD system**: Simplify distant formations
