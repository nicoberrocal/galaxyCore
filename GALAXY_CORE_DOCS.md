## Technical Implementation

### Data Model Approach
The game uses a hybrid data model that combines:
1. Embedded documents for system defense
2. Separate collections for active fleets
3. Denormalized references for performance

### Consistency Rules
1. **System State**
   - DefendingFleet existence â†” IsColonized state
   - Original owner protection mechanics
   - Allied fleet integration

2. **Player Assets**
   - Mutually exclusive arrays for tracking
   - Clear ownership hierarchies
   - Resource balance management

### Performance Considerations
1. **Combat Resolution**
   - Single document updates for system battles
   - Parallel processing for free space combat
   - Atomic operations for resource extraction

2. **Resource Management**
   - Cached production rates
   - Periodic state updates
   - Optimistic locking for conflicts

### Planet-Specific Mechanics

#### Resource Suitability
```go
Mercury:
    Metals:   0.8
    Crystals: 1.2
Venus:
    Metals:   0.6
    Crystals: 0.7
Earth:
    Metals:   1.0
    Crystals: 0.9
Mars:
    Metals:   1.2
    Crystals: 0.5
```

#### Energy Production Efficiency
```go
Base Output:
    Hydro:   100
    Solar:   80
    Wind:    60
    Balloon: 50
```
